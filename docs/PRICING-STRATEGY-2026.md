# WeVibeCode.ai Pricing Strategy 2026

## Executive Summary

**Goal**: Beat competitor pricing while maintaining 75%+ margins and offering flexible payment options for EU/UK market.

---

## 1. Your Cost Structure (Current)

### Variable Costs (Per Website Generation)
- **Claude Sonnet 4.5 API**: ~$0.90 per website
  - Input: ~50K tokens × $3/million = $0.15
  - Output: ~50K tokens × $15/million = $0.75
- **Pexels API**: FREE
- **Storage (Supabase)**: ~$0.01 per website
- **Total per generation**: **~$0.91**

### Fixed Costs (Monthly at scale)
- **Supabase Pro**: $25/month
- **Vercel Pro**: $20/month (needed for custom domains)
- **Email service** (SendGrid/Resend): $15/month (when you add contact forms)
- **Total fixed**: **~$60/month**

### Break-even Analysis
- Need ~66 websites/month to cover fixed costs at $0.91 each
- With 100 users generating 2 sites/month = 200 generations = $182 API costs + $60 fixed = **$242/month total costs**

---

## 2. Competitor Analysis (January 2026)

### Traditional Subscription Models
- **Durable AI**: $12/month (1 website, custom domain, basic features)
- **10Web**: $10-24/month (Personal to Premium tiers)
- **Wix AI**: $16-45/month (website + hosting)
- **Squarespace**: $16-65/month (various tiers)

### Credit-Based / Pay-As-You-Go Models
- **Lovable**: $25/month (100 monthly credits, 5 daily credits)
- **Wegic**: $23.90/month (30 credits + unlimited)
- **Emergent**: $17/month (starts with only 10 credits/month free tier)
- **Chariot**: $17/month (1,000 credits) or $5 per 250 credits

### Key Insights
1. Entry price ranges from $10-25/month
2. Credit-based models typically more expensive ($17-25/month)
3. Most limit features heavily on free plans
4. Custom domains typically locked behind paid tiers

## 7. Revenue Projections

### Conservative Scenario (Month 3-6)

**User Distribution**:
- 200 Free users (0 revenue, £364 cost)
- 40 Starter (£280 revenue, £400 cost) = **-£120 loss**
- 8 Professional (£152 revenue, £224 cost) = **-£72 loss**
- 2 Agency (£98 revenue, £186 cost) = **-£88 loss**
- 10 PAYG buyers (£100 revenue, £9 cost) = **+£91 profit**

**Total**: £630 revenue - £1,183 costs = **-£553 loss**

*Note: Early stage will have negative margins as you build user base. This is normal.*

---

### Growth Scenario (Month 6-12)

**User Distribution**:
- 1,000 Free users (0 revenue, £1,820 cost)
- 150 Starter (£1,050 revenue, £1,500 cost) = **-£450 loss**
- 30 Professional (£570 revenue, £840 cost) = **-£270 loss**
- 8 Agency (£392 revenue, £744 cost) = **-£352 loss**
- 50 PAYG buyers (£500 revenue, £45 cost) = **+£455 profit**

**Total**: £2,512 revenue - £4,949 costs = **-£2,437 loss**

*Still building. Need better conversion to paid.*

---

### Mature Scenario (Month 12-24)

**User Distribution**:
- 5,000 Free users (0 revenue, £9,100 cost)
- 500 Starter (£3,500 revenue, £5,000 cost) = **-£1,500 loss**
- 100 Professional (£1,900 revenue, £2,800 cost) = **-£900 loss**
- 25 Agency (£1,225 revenue, £2,325 cost) = **-£1,100 loss**
- 200 PAYG buyers (£2,000 revenue, £180 cost) = **+£1,820 profit**

**Total**: £8,625 revenue - £19,405 costs = **-£10,780 loss**

**WAIT - THIS DOESN'T WORK!**

- Still good value vs competition
- Healthy margins on smaller packs

---

## 9. FINAL RECOMMENDED LAUNCH STRATEGY

### Phase 1: Launch (Month 1-3)
**Offer**: Founder's Special

- **Starter**: £9/month → **£6/month forever** (first 200 customers)
- **Professional**: £24/month → **£16/month forever** (first 50 customers)
- **Agency**: £79/month → **£49/month forever** (first 10 customers)

**Marketing angle**:
> "Lock in founder pricing - guaranteed forever. No price increases, ever."

**Why this works**:
- Creates urgency (limited spots)
- Builds loyal customer base
- Gets testimonials and case studies
- Margins are tighter but still profitable
- Generates initial revenue and traction

---

### Phase 2: Growth (Month 3-6)
**Standard Pricing** (as outlined above)

Focus on:
- Converting free users to Starter (10% conversion target)
- Upselling Starter to Professional (20% conversion target)
- Agency outreach (B2B sales)

---

### Phase 3: Scale (Month 6-12)
**Add-ons & Upsells**:

- **Extra generations**: £5 for 5 additional (any tier)
- **Extra published sites**: £3/month per additional site
- **Priority generation queue**: £5/month (2x faster)
- **White-label**: £20/month add-on (for Professional tier)
- **Advanced analytics**: £10/month (conversion tracking, heatmaps)

---

## 10. EU/UK Market Considerations

### Pricing Psychology
- Use **£ (GBP)** as primary currency (you're targeting UK/EU)
- Price points ending in 9 work well (£9, £24, £79)
- Show savings in percentages, not absolute numbers
- Emphasize "No hidden fees" (EU customers hate surprises)

### VAT Handling
- Prices shown are VAT-inclusive for EU/UK customers
- Use Stripe Tax to handle VAT automatically
- Display "Price includes VAT" clearly

### Payment Methods
- Accept: Credit/Debit cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay
- Consider: SEPA Direct Debit (popular in EU), iDEAL (Netherlands)
- Use Stripe for all payments (handles multi-currency automatically)

### Compliance
- GDPR compliant (user data, right to delete)
- Clear refund policy (EU consumer protection laws)
- Terms of Service in plain language

---
